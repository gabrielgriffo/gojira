#### Setting up Keyring in WSL2 (Optional - for maximum security)
To enable native keyring support in WSL2:

1. **Install gnome-keyring**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install gnome-keyring
   ```

2. **Start the keyring daemon**:
   ```bash
   gnome-keyring-daemon --start --components=secrets
   ```

3. **Add to your shell profile** (optional, for automatic startup):
   ```bash
   echo 'gnome-keyring-daemon --start --components=secrets' >> ~/.bashrc
   ```

After setup, restart Gojira to use native keyring storage for maximum security.
